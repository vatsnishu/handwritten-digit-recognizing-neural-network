# handwritten-digit-recognizing-neural-network

1. Implemented a simple 3-layer feed-forward neural network for Multi-class classification
problem. Used sigmoid activation function. Implemented back-propagation for training
the parameters. Did not use any standard Neural Network library and
written code from scratch.

2. Finally, trained this network to learn a 3-class classifier for optical character recognition
for any three digits between 0 and 9.
3. Data : Used three digits between 0 and 9 from the optdigits data set that comes from
the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machinelearning-databases/optdigits/
4. Pre-processing : Digitized and down-sample images (to 8 × 8 or so).
5. Classifier : Tried few configurations for a 3-Layer Neural Network with varying number of hidden units and three output units and report learned weights from backpropagation done using training data.
6. Report : For different choices of nH (number of hidden nodes).
• Drawn representative neural network architecture
• Reported experiments and results including the learned weights in a
table and intermediate output of hidden layers for each of the three characters
after learning is over.
